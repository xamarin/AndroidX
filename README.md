Microsoft creates and maintains .NET for Android bindings for many of Google's Java/Kotlin 
Android libraries and their required third-party dependency libraries, such as:

- [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) ([Google Release Notes](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/versions/stable-channel))
- [Google Play Services](https://developers.google.com/android) ([Google Release Notes](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/releases))
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) ([Google Release Notes](https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/android))
- [ML Kit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit) ([Google Release Notes](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/release-notes))

Note that support for Xamarin.Android ended on [May 1st, 2024](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/xamarin). New versions of these packages will only support .NET for Android.

## Binding Policies

- This repository binds over 600 Android libraries that are published to [NuGet.org](https://nuget.org). The full 
  package list can be found in [config.json](config.json).
- Most Google Java/Kotlin artifacts and some dependencies come from [Google's Maven Respository](https://maven.google.com/web/index.html#).
- Additional dependencies come from [Maven/Sonatype Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/).
- The major/minor/patch version numbers mirror the bound Android library version. For example, the NuGet `Xamarin.AndroidX.Core 1.3.2.1` 
  binds version `1.3.2` of the AndroidX library `androidx.core:core`.
  - The revision version number is used when a new NuGet needs to be built but the Android library has not been updated.
- We endeavor to release updated NuGets within a few weeks after new Android releases, however large changes occasionally require 
  more time.
- In general, we do not bind pre-release libraries. As their API is not stable yet, it results in too much rework. Additionally,
  it can result in stable NuGet packages depending on unstable NuGet packages.

## Support

Note that these packages are largely just autogenerated bindings around Google's Android libraries.  As such, our support is limited to issues caused by our bindings.  For tutorials/samples/support using the libraries themselves, please refer to [Google's documentation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack).
