### What is AndroidX

AndroidX (also called Jetpack) is a de-facto standard for Android application development and major 
improvement to the original [Android Support Library](https://github.com/xamarin/AndroidSupportComponents). 
AndroidX packages fully replace the Android Support Library by providing feature parity and new libraries.

From: https://developer.android.com/jetpack

Jetpack is a suite of libraries to help developers follow best practices, reduce boilerplate code, and 
write code that works consistently across Android versions and devices so that developers can focus on 
the code they care about.

From: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/getting-started

Jetpack encompasses a collection of Android libraries that incorporate best practices and provide backwards 
compatibility in your Android apps.

The Jetpack guide to app architecture provides an overview of the best practices and recommended architecture 
to consider as you build your Android app.
